# imaginaria

Simple Django app voluntarily developed for public voting in a photobook contest.
Using HTMX (which is awesome) and SQLite (despite the hate it is a production safe database and fits perfectly this seasonal app).
Originally deployed to a standard Ubuntu AWS Lightsail instance along with Gunicorn and Nginx.
PWA ready, but disabled it because it's really not necessary for a temporary festival app.
