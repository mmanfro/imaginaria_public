# imaginaria photobook contest

<p>Simple Django app voluntarily developed for public voting in a photobook contest.</p>
<p>Using HTMX (which is awesome) and SQLite (despite the hate it is a production safe database and fits perfectly this seasonal app).</p>
<p>Originally deployed to a standard Ubuntu AWS Lightsail instance along with Gunicorn and Nginx.</p>
<p>PWA ready, but disabled it because it's really not necessary for a temporary festival app.</p>
